Module      : Qsort
Description : A simple implementation of Qsort.

A simple implementation of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qsort Qsort>.

From "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Hutton.

>>> qsort [3,5,1,2,4,2]
[1,2,2,3,4,5]

If @a <= x@ is replaced with @a < x@, then only unique values are reported.

>>> qsort' [3,5,1,2,4,2]
[1,2,3,4,5]

To reverse sort, switch smaller and larger in 'qsort'.

>>> qsort'' [3,5,1,2,4,2]
[5,4,3,2,2,1]
