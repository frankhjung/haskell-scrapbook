This Haskell code defines a module to simulate simple
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator harmonic oscillation>, like
the motion of a pendulum. It does this using a 'State' monad to manage the
changing position and time.

== Example usage

To compute the position of a harmonic oscillator:

@
let positions = evalState harmonic (HarmonicOscillation 0 0)
take 10 positions
@

[@evalState harmonic (HarmonicOscillation 0 0)@] This runs the harmonic
computation, starting with an initial state where position is 0 and time is 0.

[@evalState@] discards the final state and gives you just the result, which is
an infinite list of positions.

[@take 10 positions@] Since positions is an infinite list, you use a function
like 'take' to get a finite number of elements from it.

-- | Represents the state of a harmonic oscillator.

-- moment: its current position and the current time.
data HarmonicOscillation = HarmonicOscillation

-- | Step function to update the state of the harmonic oscillator.
-- It calculates the new position based on the sine function and increments
-- the time. Returns the new position.

step = do

    let p' = sin t

-- | This function generates an infinite list of positions over time.
