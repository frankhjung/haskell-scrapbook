Reverse a list using foldl and foldr.

-- | Reverse a list using foldl.

-- | Reverse a list using foldr.
-- This is the best performing version.
-- Same as:
-- @
-- myRevr xs = foldr (\ x acc -> (x :) >>> acc) id xs []
-- @

    rev op acc (x:xs) = rev op (acc `op` x) xs

-- | Operation to place element at the beginning of a list.
-- Same as:
-- @
-- revOp xs x = x : xs
