# Haskell Scrapbook

A collection of short scripts testing functions and techniques.

## Documentation

[Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/index.html) API
documentation is available on:

* [GitHub](https://frankhjung.github.io/haskell-scrapbook/)
* [GitLab](https://frankhjung1.gitlab.io/haskell-scrapbook)

## Haskell

These examples are meant to be run using
[runhaskell(1)](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/runhaskell.1.html) or
[runghc(1)](https://manpages.debian.org/stable/ghc/runghc.1.en.html).

The reason they won't link is because I've added them to their own module, and
have not yet gotten around to build an Ã¼ber main yet. The idea was really to
test an run code snippets quickly without having to bother with compiling and
linking a main module.

The compilation using make is to validate the source files.

### Check

Build using GNU Make:

```bash
make [target]
```

To only perform code checks, run:

```bash
make check
```

This is the default goal.

## Word Count in Python

I've also included a Python equivalent to word count program.

Get help [PyDoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html) with:

```bash
pydoc3 wordcount.py
pydoc3 wordcount.word_count
```

The later produces a short function summary:

```text
$ pydoc3 wordcount.word_count
Help on function word_count in wordcount:

wordcount.word_count = word_count(stream: 'file') -> 'int'
    Count words in stream.
```

### Build

To format source code:

```bash
yapf --style google --parallel -i *.py
```

To lint:

```bash
pylint *.py
```

## Test

To test program run:

```bash
cat wordcount.hs | python3 ./wordcount.py
```

This should return `38`. i.e. This should return `PASS`:

```bash
export f=wordcount.hs
cat $f | python3 ./wordcount.py | (read count ; test $count -eq $(wc -w $f | cut -d ' ' -f1 -) && echo "PASS")
```

## Literate Haskell

To print [bird.lhs](./bird.lhs) to PDF, use:

```bash
pandoc -r markdown+lhs -s bird.lhs --css haskell.css -o bird.pdf
```

To render to HTML use:

```bash
make bird.html
```

## Haskell Notebook

Included is a Jupyter Notebook with a
[Haskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) runtime.

To start run this:

```bash
stack exec jupyter -- notebook
```
